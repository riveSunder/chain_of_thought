 Q: The cash register at the ice cream store started the day with $20. During the day, the store earned $66 selling ice cream. The manager also paid for a delivery out of the cash register. At the end of the day, the cash register had $54. How much did the delivery cost?
A: 
	few-shot Response:

The answer is $10.

Explanation:
To find the cost of the delivery, we need to calculate the amount of money that was spent between the start of the day and the end of the day. This is the difference between the amount of money the store started with and the amount of money that was left in the cash register at the end of the day.

So, we start with $20 and add the earnings from selling ice cream, which is $66. This gives us a total of $86.

Then, we subtract the amount of money left in the cash register at the end of the day, which is $54. This gives us the cost of the delivery, which is $32.

Finally, we subtract the cost of the delivery from the total amount of money spent, which is $32 + $20 = $52. This gives us the answer of $10.

The problem is asking how much the delivery cost, given that the cash register started with $20, earned $66 from selling ice cream, and ended with $54 after the delivery.

To solve the problem, we need to first find out how much money was spent on the delivery. We can do this by subtracting the amount of money in the cash register at the end of the day ($54) from the amount of money the store earned ($66).

So, the delivery cost:

66 - 54 = 12

Therefore, the answer is 12. The delivery cost $12.

A: To find out how much the delivery cost, we need to subtract the total amount of money earned from the total amount of money left in the cash register at the end of the day.

So, $66 (total earned) + $54 (total left in cash register) = $120.

We need to subtract $20 (starting amount) from $120 (total amount earned + total left in cash register) to find the amount spent on the delivery.

$120 (total amount) - $20 (starting amount) = $100.

Therefore, the delivery cost $100.

To find out how much the delivery cost, you can follow these steps:

1. Start with the amount of money the cash register had at the beginning of the day, which was $20.
2. Add the amount of money the store earned from selling ice cream, which was $66.
3. Subtract the amount of money left in the cash register at the end of the day, which was $54.

This gives you the amount of money that the manager paid for the delivery, which is the answer you are looking for. So, the delivery cost was $54 - $20 + $66 = $54 + $66 = $120.

Therefore, the delivery cost $120.

Please solve the following problem:
 Q: I used 12 sheets of toilet paper each day for 4 days. The roll had 96 sheets when it was new. How many sheets of toilet paper have not been used?
A: Let's think step-by-step: 
	few-shot + 'Let's think step-by-step' Response:

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many sheets of toilet paper were used in total and how many sheets were left unused.

First, we need to find out how many sheets of toilet paper were used in 4 days.
12 sheets/day x 4 days = 48 sheets/4 days

Then, we need to subtract the total number of sheets used from the total number of sheets in the roll to find out how many sheets were unused.
96 sheets/roll - 48 sheets/4 days = 48 sheets/roll unused

Therefore, there are 48 sheets of toilet paper that have not been used.

First, you used 12 sheets of toilet paper each day for 4 days, which means you used a total of 12 sheets per day x 4 days = 48 sheets in 4 days.

Next, you need to subtract the number of sheets you used from the number of sheets on the roll when it was new, which is 96 sheets.

So, the number of sheets of toilet paper that have not been used is 96 sheets - 48 sheets = 48 sheets.

  Q: The school library started the day with 23 books. During the day, 3 books were returned. After the library sent one book to another library via inter-library loan and checked out several others to library visitors, the school library had 14 books. How many books were checked out?
A: 
	zero-shot Response:

To find out how many books were checked out, you need to subtract the number of books in the library at the end of the day from the initial number of books.

Initial number of books = 23
Books returned = 3
Books sent to another library = 1
Books checked out =?
Final number of books = 14

So, the number of books checked out can be calculated as:

Books checked out = Initial number of books - Books returned - Books sent to another library - Final number of books
Books checked out = 23 - 3 - 1 - 14
Books checked out = 6

Therefore, 6 books were checked out from the school library.

 Q: The school library started the day with 23 books. During the day, 3 books were returned. After the library sent one book to another library via inter-library loan and checked out several others to library visitors, the school library had 14 books. How many books were checked out?
A: 
	few-shot Response:

The answer is 5.

Explanation:
To find out how many books were checked out, we need to subtract the number of books the school library had at the end of the day from the number of books it had at the beginning of the day, after taking into account the books returned and sent to the other library via inter-library loan.

Starting with 23 books, the library had 3 more books returned, making it 23 + 3 = 26 books.
The library then sent one book to the other library via inter-library loan, leaving it with 26 - 1 = 25 books.
Finally, the school library checked out several other books, bringing the total down to 14.

So, the number of books checked out is 25 - 14 = 11.
However, the question asked for the number of books specifically checked out and not the total number of books checked out and the books sent via inter-library loan. Therefore, the correct answer is 11 - 1 = 5 books.

A: Let's think step-by-step: 
	chain-of-thought + 'Let's think step-by-step' Response:

There were 23 books in the library at the beginning of the day. 3 books were returned, so there were 23 - 3 + x books in the library, where x is the number of books checked out.
23 - 3 + x = 14

Subtract 23 - 3 from both sides:
x = 14 - 23 + 3
x = 14 - 20
x = -6

So, -6 books were checked out, which doesn't make sense as a solution. This problem may have an error or missing information.

* Let's call the number of books checked out "x". So, the number of books left after the library sent one book and checked out "x" is 20 - x.
* Since there are 14 books left, we can write the equation: 20 - x = 14.

To find out how many jelly beans you ate each day, you need to divide the total number of jelly beans you put in the bowl by the number of days it took for the jelly beans to be reduced to 13.

So, you put 61 jelly beans in the bowl 6 days ago, which means you have eaten 61 - 13 = 48 jelly beans.

To find out how many jelly beans you ate each day, you can divide the total number of jelly beans you ate (48) by the number of days (6):

48 ÷ 6 = 8

Therefore, you ate 8 jelly beans each day.

 Q: I put 61 jelly beans in a bowl 6 days ago. Now there are 13 jelly beans left. If I ate the same number of jelly beans each day, how many jelly beans did I eat each day? 
A: Let's think step-by-step: 
	few-shot + 'Let's think step-by-step' Response:

To solve this problem, we can start by finding out how many jelly beans were eaten each day. Since there were 61 jelly beans in the bowl 6 days ago and 13 jelly beans are left, that means 61 - 13 = 48 jelly beans were eaten.

To find out how many jelly beans were eaten each day, we can divide the total number of jelly beans eaten by the number of days. So, 48 jelly beans / 6 days = 8 jelly beans per day.

Therefore, the answer is: Olivia ate 8 jelly beans each day for 6 days.

  Q: I put 61 jelly beans in a bowl 6 days ago. Now there are 13 jelly beans left. If I ate the same number of jelly beans each day, how many jelly beans did I eat each day? 
A: Let's think step-by-step: 
	zero-shot + 'Let's think step-by-step' Response:

You have correctly identified the steps involved in solving this problem:

1. Determine the total number of jelly beans that were in the bowl at the beginning.
2. Subtract the number of jelly beans that are left in the bowl to find out how many were eaten each day.
3. Divide the total number of jelly beans eaten by the number of days to find out how many jelly beans were eaten each day.

To start solving the problem, we can use the information given in the question:

* The original number of jelly beans = 61
* The remaining number of jelly beans = 13

Next, we can use subtraction to find out how many jelly beans were eaten each day:

* Total number of jelly beans eaten = 61 - 13 = 48

Finally, we can use division to find out how many jelly beans were eaten each day:

* Jelly beans eaten each day = 48 / 6 = 8

Therefore, the answer to the problem is:

* I ate 8 jelly beans each day.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

A: 
	zero-shot Response:

To find out how much money Taylor has left, we need to subtract the amount spent on sneakers from the original amount of money Taylor had, and then add the amount earned by winning the race.

Original amount of money Taylor had = $78
Amount spent on sneakers = $57
Amount earned by winning the race = $5

So, Taylor has:
$78 - $57 + $5 = $26

Therefore, Taylor has $26 left.

You are correct in your approach. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Bob scored 3 points during each of the first 3 quarters. So, in total, he scored 3 x 3 = 9 points.
2. In the last quarter, Bob scored 4 points.
3. To find the total number of points Bob scored during the game, we need to add the points he scored in the first 3 quarters to the points he scored in the last quarter.
4. So, the total number of points Bob scored during the game is 9 + 4 = 13.

Therefore, Bob scored 13 points during the game.

A: 
	zero-shot Response:

To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of subtraction and addition.

First, we know that you had $33 before earning $12 walking dogs, so your total amount of money would be:

$33 + $12 = $45

After spending some money on concert tickets, you have $3 remaining, so we can subtract the amount of money you spent from the total amount of money you had:

$45 - $3 = $42

Therefore, you spent $42 on concert tickets.

Please solve the following problem:
 Q: I had $33. Then I earned $12 walking dogs. After I spent some money for concert tickets, I have $3 remaining. How much money did I spend on concert tickets?
A: 
	few-shot Response:

A: To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Start with the total amount of money Olivia had before she earned money from walking dogs, which is $33.
2. Add the amount of money she earned from walking dogs, which is $12. This gives you a total of $45.
3. Subtract the amount of money she spent on concert tickets from the total amount of money she had after earning money from walking dogs. The amount spent on concert tickets is not given, so we'll call it "x". The equation would be:
$45 - x = $3
4. Subtract $45 from both sides of the equation to isolate the variable "x":
$45 - $45 - x = $3 - $45
5. Simplify the equation:
$0 - x = -$42
6. Flip the equation to solve for "x":
x = -$42

Therefore, Olivia spent $42 on concert tickets. However, since the amount of money spent cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem statement. It is possible that the problem meant to say that Olivia had $45 at first and ended up with $3 after spending some money on concert tickets. In that case, the solution would be:
45 - x = 3
45 - 3 = x
42 = x
Olivia spent $42 on concert tickets.
