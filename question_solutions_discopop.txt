A: 
	zero-shot Response:

To find out how much the delivery cost, you need to subtract the total earnings from the remaining amount in the cash register, and then subtract the initial amount the register had in the beginning.

Let's do the calculations:

1. Total earnings + Initial amount = $66 + $20 = $86
2. Total amount in the cash register after the delivery = $54
3. Delivery cost = Total amount in the cash register - Total earnings
4. Delivery cost = $86 - $54 = $32

The delivery cost was $32.

Q: I used 12 sheets of toilet paper each day for 4 days. The roll had 96 sheets when it was new. How many sheets of toilet paper have not been used?

A: To solve this problem, first, we need to calculate the total number of sheets used in 4 days. Since each day 12 sheets are used, we can multiply this by 4.

Total sheets used = 12 sheets/day \* 4 days = 48 sheets

Now, we can find the number of sheets not used by subtracting the total sheets used from the total sheets on the roll when it was new.

Sheets not used = Total sheets on the roll - Total sheets used
Sheets not used = 96 sheets - 48 sheets = 48 sheets

Therefore, there are 48 sheets of toilet paper that have not been used.

 Q: I used 12 sheets of toilet paper each day for 4 days. The roll had 96 sheets when it was new. How many sheets of toilet paper have not been used?
A: Let's think step-by-step: 
	few-shot + 'Let's think step-by-step' Response:

First, let's calculate how many sheets of toilet paper were used in total over the 4 days:

12 sheets/day x 4 days = 48 sheets used

Next, let's subtract the total number of sheets used from the original number of sheets on the roll:

96 sheets (original) - 48 sheets (used) = 48 sheets not used

The answer is 48 sheets of toilet paper have not been used.

A: 
	zero-shot Response:

To find the number of books checked out, you need to subtract the initial number of books (23), the number of books returned (3), the number of books sent via inter-library loan (1), and the number of books still in the library (14).

First, find the total number of books removed from the library:
23 (initial books) - 3 (returned books) - 1 (inter-library loan) = 20 books
Now, subtract the total number of books removed from the final number of books in the library:
14 (final books) - 20 (total books removed) = -6

Since the result is negative, it means there was an error in the problem statement. It appears that there was a mistake in the final count of books in the library, as it cannot be less than the number of books removed. Please double-check the problem statement and let me know if there are any corrections or additional details.

A: 
	few-shot Response:

To find out how many books were checked out, you need to subtract the number of books the library had at the end (14) from the total number of books (23) at the beginning, and then add the number of books returned (3).

Solution:
14 (books at the end) + 3 (books returned) + x (books checked out) = 23 (total books at the beginning)

x = 23 - 14 - 3
x = 6

6 books were checked out.

So, the answer is 6.

 Q: The school library started the day with 23 books. During the day, 3 books were returned. After the library sent one book to another library via inter-library loan and checked out several others to library visitors, the school library had 14 books. How many books were checked out?
A: 
	chain-of-thought Response:

To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many books were left in the library after the inter-library loan and checkout.

Initial books - Books returned + Books sent out + Books checked out = Final books

23 books - 3 books + 1 book (inter-library loan) + x books (books checked out) = 14 books

Now, let's simplify and solve for x:

19 + 1 + x = 14

x = 14 - 19 - 1

x = -6

Since the number of books cannot be negative, we made an error in our calculations. We should subtract the final number of books from the initial books and books returned, and then add the books sent out:

23 books - 3 books + 1 book = 21 books

Now, let's find out how many books were checked out:

21 books - 23 books + 1 book = -1 books

Since the number of books cannot be negative, there might be some missing information in the problem statement. Please double-check the problem and provide the correct information.

A: Let's think step-by-step: 
	zero-shot + 'Let's think step-by-step' Response:

You can solve this problem by following these steps:

1. Find out how many books were returned and the total number of books remaining after that.
2. Subtract the inter-library loan book and add the number of books checked out.

First, let's find out how many books were returned and the total number of books remaining after that.
23 (initial books) - 3 (returned books) = 20 (remaining books)

Now, we know there were 20 books remaining in the school library after 3 books were returned. We also know that 1 book was sent out via inter-library loan and some books were checked out.

Let's denote the number of books checked out as "x."
20 (remaining books) - 1 (inter-library loan book) + x (checked out books) = 14 (final books)

Now, we can solve for x:
20 + x = 14
x = 14 - 20
x = -6

Since the number of books checked out can't be negative, we made an error. The problem statement says that there were 14 books in total after the library sent one book and checked out some. So, 14 books were already there before the inter-library loan and checkouts.

In this case, no books were checked out.
Answer: 0 books were checked out.

To find out how many jelly beans you ate each day, you need to first find out how many jelly beans you had in total before eating any. You initially put 61 jelly beans in the bowl 6 days ago, and now there are 13 jelly beans left.

So, the total number of jelly beans you had before eating is 61 + 13 = 74.

Since you ate the same number of jelly beans each day, you can divide the total number of jelly beans by the number of days to find out how many you ate each day:

74 jelly beans / 6 days = 12 jelly beans

You ate 12 jelly beans each day.

So, the answer is 12.

 Q: I put 61 jelly beans in a bowl 6 days ago. Now there are 13 jelly beans left. If I ate the same number of jelly beans each day, how many jelly beans did I eat each day?
A: Let's think step-by-step:

 Q: I put 61 jelly beans in a bowl 6 days ago. Now there are 13 jelly beans left. If I ate the same number of jelly beans each day, how many jelly beans did I eat each day?
A: Let's think step-by-step: 
	few-shot + 'Let's think step-by-step' Response:

To solve the problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Find out how many jelly beans were eaten in total.
2. Subtract the current number of jelly beans from the initial amount to get the total jelly beans eaten.
3. Divide the total jelly beans eaten by the number of days (6) to find the jelly beans eaten each day.

Let's apply these steps:

1. Total jelly beans eaten = Initial amount - Remaining jelly beans
= 61 jelly beans - 13 jelly beans
= 48 jelly beans

2. Since 48 jelly beans were eaten in total, that's the number of jelly beans eaten each day.

3. Jelly beans eaten each day = Total jelly beans eaten / Number of days
= 48 jelly beans / 6 days
= 8 jelly beans

Therefore, the answer is 8. Each day, 8 jelly beans were eaten.

A: Let's think step-by-step: 
	zero-shot + 'Let's think step-by-step' Response:

To find out how many points Bob scored during the game, you need to consider the points he scored in the first three quarters and the last quarter.

First, Bob scored 3 points during each of the first 3 quarters, so in total, he scored 3 x 3 = 9 points in the first 3 quarters.

Then, in the last quarter, Bob scored 4 points.

To find the total points scored during the game, you need to add the points scored in the first 3 quarters and the last quarter:

Total points = 9 points (from the first 3 quarters) + 4 points (from the last quarter) = 13 points

So, Bob scored 13 points during the game.

  Q: I had $33. Then I earned $12 walking dogs. After I spent some money for concert tickets, I have $3 remaining. How much money did I spend on concert tickets?
A: 
	zero-shot Response:

To find out how much money you spent on concert tickets, you need to subtract the total amount you earned and the remaining amount from the initial amount you had.

Initial amount = $33
Earned amount = $12
Remaining amount = $3

Total amount spent on concert tickets = Initial amount - Earned amount - Remaining amount
Total amount spent on concert tickets = $33 - $12 - $3

First, subtract $12 from $33:
$33 - $12 = $21

Then, subtract $3 from $21:
$21 - $3 = $18

You spent $18 on concert tickets.

A: 
	few-shot Response:

To find out how much money Olivia spent on concert tickets, you need to subtract her remaining money and the money she earned from the initial amount she had.

Let x be the amount Olivia spent on concert tickets.

The equation to represent the problem would be:

33 + 12 - x = 3

Now, let's solve for x:

45 - x = 3

Subtract 45 from both sides:

-x = -42

Multiply both sides by -1:

x = 42

So, Olivia spent $42 on concert tickets.

The answer is: 42.

A: Let's think step-by-step: 
	few-shot + 'Let's think step-by-step' Response:

To solve the problem, you need to follow these steps:

1. You had $33 initially.
2. You earned $12 after walking dogs.
3. After spending some money on concert tickets, you have $3 left.

To find out how much you spent on concert tickets, you need to subtract the initial amount and the amount earned from the remaining amount.

1. Let's use algebra to solve this problem:
Let x be the amount spent on concert tickets.
$$33 + 12 - x = 3$$

Now, let's solve for x:

1. Add 33 and 12 to both sides:

$$45 - x = 3$$

1. Add x to both sides, and then subtract 45 from both sides:

$$3 = -x$$

1. Reverse the sign on both sides, so the negative sign becomes positive:

$$x = 3$$

So, you spent $3 on concert tickets.
