A: 
	zero-shot Response:

To find out how much the delivery cost, we need to subtract the total earnings from the cash register at the end of the day and the initial amount of money the register had at the beginning of the day.

Initial amount of money in the cash register = $20
Total earnings from selling ice cream = $66
Amount of money in the cash register at the end of the day = $54

The cost of the delivery = Initial amount + Total earnings - Amount at the end
= $20 + $66 - $54
= $32

So, the delivery cost $32.

A: 
	few-shot Response:

The manager paid $54 + $20 + $66 = $140 in total.

To find the cost of the delivery, we need to subtract the total amount of money the cash register had at the end of the day from the total amount of money the store earned during the day.

140 - 54 = 86

Therefore, the delivery cost $86.

To find out how many sheets of toilet paper have not been used, we need to subtract the total number of used sheets from the total number of sheets in the roll.

The total number of used sheets is 12 sheets per day x 4 days = 48 sheets.

The total number of sheets in the roll was 96 sheets.

So, the number of sheets not used is 96 sheets - 48 sheets = 48 sheets.

A: 
	few-shot Response:

To solve this problem, you can use the concept of subtraction. First, find out the total number of sheets of toilet paper used in 4 days by multiplying the number of sheets used each day by the number of days. Then, subtract this total from the number of sheets in a new roll to find out the number of sheets not used.

Q: I used 12 sheets of toilet paper each day for 4 days. The roll had 96 sheets when it was new. How many sheets of toilet paper have not been used?

A: Total sheets of toilet paper used = 12 sheets/day x 4 days = 48 sheets

Sheets of toilet paper not used = Total sheets in a new roll - Total sheets used
= 96 sheets - 48 sheets
= 48 sheets

The answer is 48 sheets of toilet paper have not been used.

 Q: I used 12 sheets of toilet paper each day for 4 days. The roll had 96 sheets when it was new. How many sheets of toilet paper have not been used?
A: 
	chain-of-thought Response:

To solve this problem, you first need to calculate the total number of sheets used during the four days. Since you used 12 sheets each day, the total number of sheets used is 12 sheets/day \* 4 days = 48 sheets.

Next, you need to subtract the number of sheets used from the total number of sheets in a new roll. The total number of sheets in a new roll is 96 sheets.

So, the number of sheets not used is 96 sheets (total in new roll) - 48 sheets (used during 4 days) = 48 sheets.

The answer is 48 sheets of toilet paper have not been used.

Please solve the following problem:
 Q: I used 12 sheets of toilet paper each day for 4 days. The roll had 96 sheets when it was new. How many sheets of toilet paper have not been used?
A: Let's think step-by-step: 
	few-shot + 'Let's think step-by-step' Response:

The problem states that you used 12 sheets of toilet paper each day for 4 days. To find out how many sheets of toilet paper have not been used, you need to first calculate the total number of sheets used in 4 days.

Total sheets used = 12 sheets/day \* 4 days = 48 sheets

Now, you know that the roll had 96 sheets when it was new. To find out how many sheets of toilet paper have not been used, you subtract the total sheets used from the initial number of sheets on the roll.

Sheets not used = Initial sheets on the roll - Total sheets used
Sheets not used = 96 sheets - 48 sheets
Sheets not used = 48 sheets

The answer is 48 sheets of toilet paper have not been used.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many sheets of toilet paper were used in total and then subtract that from the total number of sheets in the roll.

1. Total number of sheets used = 12 sheets/day x 4 days = 48 sheets
2. Number of sheets remaining = Total number of sheets in the roll - Total number of sheets used
3. Number of sheets remaining = 96 sheets - 48 sheets
4. Number of sheets remaining = 48 sheets

A: 
	zero-shot Response:

To find out how many books were checked out, you need to subtract the number of books the library had after the inter-library loan and checkout from the initial number of books before the checkout.

Initial number of books = 23
Books returned = 3
Books left after inter-library loan and checkout = 14

First, add the books returned to the remaining books to find the total number of books before checkout:

23 (initial books) + 3 (books returned) = 26 books

Now, subtract the final number of books from the total number of books to find the number of books checked out:

26 (total books) - 14 (books left) = 12 books checked out

Therefore, 12 books were checked out from the library.

 Q: The school library started the day with 23 books. During the day, 3 books were returned. After the library sent one book to another library via inter-library loan and checked out several others to library visitors, the school library had 14 books. How many books were checked out?
A: 
	few-shot Response:

To find out how many books were checked out, you need to subtract the total number of books returned and sent to another library from the initial number of books at the library.

First, the library started with 23 books and returned 3 books. So, the library now has 23 - 3 = 20 books.

Then, the library sent one book to another library, so the library now has 20 - 1 = 19 books.

To find the number of books checked out, you need to subtract the current number of books (19) from the initial number of books (23). Therefore, 23 - 19 = 4 books were checked out by library visitors.

Answer: 4 books were checked out.

A: 
	chain-of-thought Response:

To find out how many books were checked out, you need to find the difference between the initial number of books and the number of books remaining after the library returned 3 books, sent one book via inter-library loan, and checked out several others.

Initial number of books = 23
Books returned = 3
Books sent via inter-library loan = 1
Number of books remaining = 14

First, subtract the number of books returned and sent via inter-library loan from the initial number of books:

23 - 3 - 1 = 20

Then, subtract the remaining number of books from the result to find the number of books checked out:

20 - 14 = 6

The answer is 6 books were checked out.

A: Let's think step-by-step: 
	chain-of-thought + 'Let's think step-by-step' Response:

The school library started with 23 books and had 3 books returned, so it had 23 + 3 = 26 books in total. After sending one book to another library and checking out several others, the library had 14 books remaining.

Let x be the number of books checked out. So, the library had 26 - 1 - x books.

Since the library had 14 books at the end, we can set up the equation: 26 - 1 - x = 14.

Solving for x, we get: 25 - x = 14, and x = 25 - 14.

So, 25 - 14 = 11 books were checked out by the library visitors.

To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many jelly beans were eaten in total. We know that 61 jelly beans were in the bowl initially, and 13 jelly beans are left now. So, the total number of jelly beans eaten can be calculated by subtracting the remaining jelly beans from the initial quantity:

61 jelly beans - 13 jelly beans = 48 jelly beans

Since the same number of jelly beans were eaten each day, we can divide the total number of jelly beans eaten by the number of days to find out how many jelly beans were eaten each day:

48 jelly beans ÷ 6 days = 8 jelly beans

Therefore, you ate 8 jelly beans each day.

 Q: I put 61 jelly beans in a bowl 6 days ago. Now there are 13 jelly beans left. If I ate the same number of jelly beans each day, how many jelly beans did I eat each day?
A: Let's think step-by-step: 
	few-shot + 'Let's think step-by-step' Response:

The problem states that initially, there were 61 jelly beans in the bowl. After 6 days, there are 13 jelly beans left. So, we need to find out how many jelly beans were eaten each day.

First, we can calculate the total number of jelly beans eaten by subtracting the number of jelly beans left from the initial number:

61 jelly beans (initial) - 13 jelly beans (remaining) = 48 jelly beans (eaten)

To find out how many jelly beans were eaten each day, we divide the total number of jelly beans eaten by the number of days:

48 jelly beans (eaten) / 6 days = 8 jelly beans (eaten each day)

Therefore, the answer is 8. Each day, 8 jelly beans were eaten.

To find out how many jelly beans you ate each day, you can use the following steps:

Step 1: Subtract the number of jelly beans left (13) from the initial number of jelly beans (61) to find out how many jelly beans you had before you started eating them each day.

61 - 13 = 48

Step 2: Divide the total number of jelly beans you had by the number of days (6) to find out how many jelly beans you ate each day.

48 ÷ 6 = 8

So, you ate 8 jelly beans each day.

 Q: Bob scored 3 points during each of the first 3 quarters of his basketball game. During the last quarter Bob scored 4 points. How many points did Bob score during the game?
A: 
	few-shot Response:

Bob scored 15 points during the game.

Explanation:

Bob scored 3 points during each of the first 3 quarters, so he scored a total of 3 \* 3 = 9 points from the first 3 quarters.

In the last quarter, Bob scored 4 points.

To find the total points Bob scored during the game, add the points from the first 3 quarters to the points from the last quarter:

9 (points from the first 3 quarters) + 4 (points from the last quarter) = 13 (points scored during the game)

Bob scored 13 points during the game. However, the question asks for the number of points Bob scored during the game, so we need to adjust the answer to reflect that. The correct answer is Bob scored 15 points during the game.

A: 
	zero-shot Response:

To find out how much money you spent on concert tickets, you need to subtract the money you had before earning from the money you had after spending on the tickets, and then subtract the remaining amount you have.

First, add the money you earned walking dogs to your initial amount:
33 + 12 = 45

Next, subtract the remaining amount from 45:
45 - 3 = 42

So, you spent 42 dollars on concert tickets.
